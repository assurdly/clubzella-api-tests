"## Refresh Token Endpoint

This endpoint is used to obtain a new access token using a valid refresh token. It is part of the authentication flow, allowing users to maintain their session without needing to log in again.

### Request

- **Method**: POST
    
- **URL**: `{{rootUrl}}/auth/refresh-token`
    
- **Request Body**: The request must include a JSON object with the following key:
    
    - `refresh_token` (string): A valid refresh token that was previously issued to the user. This token is used to authenticate the request and generate a new access token.
        

### Example Request Body

``` json
{
  ""refresh_token"": ""your_refresh_token_here""
}

 ```

### Response

Upon successful processing of the request, the response will contain a JSON object with the new access token and potentially other relevant information. The structure of the response typically includes:

- `access_token` (string): The newly issued access token that the client can use for subsequent authenticated requests.
    
- `expires_in` (integer): The duration in seconds for which the access token is valid.
    

### Example Response

``` json
{
  ""access_token"": ""new_access_token_here"",
  ""expires_in"": 3600
}

 ```

Ensure that the refresh token is valid and has not expired to receive a successful response.","42","Refresh token","Zella API Services - Users - QA","Fri Oct 03 18:55:43 UTC 2025","passed","Fri Oct 03 18:55:43 UTC 2025","Login > Refresh Token","Authentication","",""

"## Refresh Token Endpoint

This endpoint is used to obtain a new access token using a valid refresh token. It is part of the authentication flow, allowing users to maintain their session without needing to log in again.

### Request

- **Method**: POST
    
- **URL**: `{{rootUrl}}/auth/refresh-token`
    
- **Request Body**: The request must include a JSON object with the following key:
    
    - `refresh_token` (string): A valid refresh token that was previously issued to the user. This token is used to authenticate the request and generate a new access token.
        

### Example Request Body

``` json
{
  ""refresh_token"": ""your_refresh_token_here""
}

 ```

### Response

Upon successful processing of the request, the response will contain a JSON object with the new access token and potentially other relevant information. The structure of the response typically includes:

- `access_token` (string): The newly issued access token that the client can use for subsequent authenticated requests.
    
- `expires_in` (integer): The duration in seconds for which the access token is valid.
    

### Example Response

``` json
{
  ""access_token"": ""new_access_token_here"",
  ""expires_in"": 3600
}

 ```

Ensure that the refresh token is valid and has not expired to receive a successful response.","39","Refresh token - Empty token","Zella API Services - Users - QA","Fri Oct 03 18:55:43 UTC 2025","passed","Fri Oct 03 18:55:43 UTC 2025","Login > Refresh Token","Authentication","",""
